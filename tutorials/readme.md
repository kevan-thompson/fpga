This folder contains a basic VHDL files, TestBenches, and FPGA projects used to teach co-ops who to write VHDL.

## 1) Basic Gates

The file gates.vhd will show you how to create all the basic logic gates in VHDL. (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR) as well as explain some of the basics of a VHDL file.

The testbench gates_tb.vhd is a basic testbench that can be used to simulate gates.vhd in your simulator of choice. (Modelsim etc) and explains some of the basics of a TestBenches

## 2) Adders

TBD
